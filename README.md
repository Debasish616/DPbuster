Dark Pattern Recognition
This web browser extension “DPbuster”, is intended to help consumers to navigate the internet in a way similar to an ad blocker. However, the highlighter differs from ad blockers in one crucial aspect: it does not block individual dark patterns on websites but highlights them so that consumers become aware of the influences affecting them. In addition, the tool informs about the type of pattern.

Additional Features: –

No Blocking of Web Page Content: The extension ensures that it does not block web page content, allowing users to access information while still benefiting from dark pattern detection.

Extension Icon Displaying Number of Detected Dark Patterns: The extension icon dynamically displays the number of detected dark patterns, providing users with a quick visual indicator of potential issues on the webpage.

Function to Individually Highlight Each Detected Dark Pattern: Users have the ability to individually highlight each detected dark pattern out of the 9 famous and profound type of dark patterns.
